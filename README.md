# Hieroxide

My attempt at a Rust port of Dr Nederhof's most excellent HieroJax lib.

## Disclaimer

I am very new to Rust, and still figuring out a lot about the language, which includes some really ugly code,
awkward ways about going through things, as I'm exploring, etc.

Ultimately, I'll actually make something that's production-worthy, but for now I'm just learning.
